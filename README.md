# CS2 Lab Project - Restaurant Management System

## Overview

This project is a simple Restaurant Management System built as a lab project for the CS2 course. It uses C++ and the Qt framework for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to interact with various aspects of restaurant management, such as menu management, user sign-in, and payment processing.

## Features

- **Menu Management**: Add, edit, and remove food items from the restaurant's menu.
- **User Authentication**: A sign-in window allows users to log in securely.
- **Payment Processing**: A module for handling customer payments.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A user-friendly interface created using Qt.

## File Structure

- **main.cpp**: The entry point for the application.
- **food.cpp / food.h**: Handles the data and functionality related to food items.
- **foodmenu.cpp / foodmenu.h**: Manages the restaurant's menu.
- **payment.cpp / payment.h**: Processes payments within the system.
- **user.cpp / user.h**: Manages user data and authentication.
- **sign_in_window.cpp / sign_in_window.h / sign_in_window.ui**: Implements the sign-in interface.
- **foodmenu.ui**: The user interface layout for the food menu.
- **payment.ui**: The user interface layout for the payment system.
- **QTstore.pro**: The Qt project file containing build configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Qt Framework**: Make sure you have Qt installed on your system.
- **C++ Compiler**: A C++ compiler such as g++ is required to compile the source code.

### Installation

   \`\`\`sh
   git clone https://github.com/omarsaqr12/CS2-lab-project.git
   cd CS2-lab-project
   \`\`\`

2. Open the project file (`QTstore.pro`) in Qt Creator or another Qt-compatible IDE.

3. Build and run the project.

### Usage

After running the application, you'll be presented with the main interface where you can:
